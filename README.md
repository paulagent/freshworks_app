This Document briefly describes how I sovle this problem.

AfterI got the requirement, the first thing  I want to clarify some unclear parts.  Make sure there is no ambiguity. 

The first thing is to decide technology stack. I choose to use Grails 3 as backend, React as frontend. Database is postgres.

The first reason is I knew these frameworks so I can start immediately.

the second reason is they are mature solotions.  Especially like Grails, It encapsulate a lot of details for users. therefore we do not need to worry these things. 

As a good practice rule, do not reinvent wheels. I am not start from the scratch. This project start from a boilerplate code base that I found in Github.
